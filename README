This script will vocally alert you when NOAA issues weather warnings in your neighborhood.

you'll need to configure the samecodes.txt, change the name of the location to your location and visit:

http://www.nws.noaa.gov/nwr/coverage/county_coverage.html

to find the same code of your neighborhood.

todo: 
  automate the location figuring
  refine the voice
  port to windows
  make a RaspberryPi.0.W system out of this, with a big button on top.
